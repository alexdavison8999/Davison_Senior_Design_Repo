# Abstract
We are developing a virtual assistant device (EVA) to help elderly people take their medication properly. EVA will utilize speech and image recognition in order to allow the user to easily interface with it. User's will now be able to take their medicine the right way at the right time, and never run out of medication unexpectedly. EVA will report to physicians on prescription use metrics.
