# Andrew
1. Research and document HIPAA certification guidelines that relate to EVA

2. Research and Document other virtual assistant devices on the market

3. Brainstorm useful features beyond the scope of medication reminders that would be able to be easily implemented into our current design

# Yugo
1. Research and document other Medication distribution devices for us to compare to

2. Design some rough sketches for EVA as far as the layout of the components and how the final product will look

3. Model in CAD the components obtained (screen, camera, speaker) with accurate measurements to later be used when printing housing

4. Research 3D printing practices and interfacing between a CAD model and a 3D Printer

5. Utilize a 3D printer to print a housing for the components based on our final design choices

# Alex
1. Organize, facilitate, run and lead team / team meetings

2. Research existing speech recognition libraries and experiment on which would be best for EVA

3. Demonstrate an implementation of a speech recognition library, catering it towards our uses of medicine reminders

4. Develop software to scrape Drugs.com pages for information and recite it to the user on command

5. Develop a start sequence for the user, where the user interfaces with the device via voice, touch, and video to set up needed information for the device like wifi, name of user, and medication information

6. Load software and operating system onto Raspberry Pi

# Ram
1. Research existing image recognition libraries and experiment on which would be best for EVA

2. Research image recognition on cylindrical surfaces/  panoramic photos / image stitching and relay findings

3. Demonstrate an implementation of an image recognition library, specifically on a cylindrical surface using the information researched in the above task.

4. Generate a parts list for the final build.

5. Research interfacing EVA with EMR for prescription refills and automatic device setup
